  "Experimental":
    "The API is not yet stabilized. You can try it out and provide feedback, but we may change or remove it in future versions without having to pass through a formal deprecation process.",
  "Unstable":
    "The API is in the process of settling, but has not yet had sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable. Backwards-compatibility will be maintained if reasonable. If we do have to make backwards-incompatible changes, we will not guarantee the module will go through the formal deprecation process.",
  "Stable":
    "The API is a fully-supported part. We will avoid breaking backwards compatibility unless absolutely necessary. If we do have to make backwards-incompatible changes, we will go through the formal deprecation process.",
  "Deprecated":
    "We plan to change this API. Backwards compatibility should not be expected. Donâ€™t start using it, and plan to migrate away from this API to its formal replacement."
