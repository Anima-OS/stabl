#### Stability

[![](https://anima-os.github.io/stabl-badges/stable.svg)](https://github.com/Anima-OS/stabl-badges "Stable: The API is a fully-supported part. We will avoid breaking backwards compatibility unless absolutely necessary. If we do have to make backwards-incompatible changes, we will go through the formal deprecation process.")

## Stabl - Stability indices for your JavaScript library

**Stabl** provides an easy to use commandline interface to add stability information to your README and package.json.

## Installation

```
$ npm install -g stabl
```

## Usage

```
$ stabl <STABILITY>
```

``<STABILITY>`` has to be one of: 
* Experimental
* Unstable
* Stable
* Deprecated

Run ``stabl`` without any stability option to print the local ``help``.
